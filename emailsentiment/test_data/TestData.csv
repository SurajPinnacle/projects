4d532d37-d7e7-4602-96e8-16080882d94f,"Dipayan, It was discovered this morning that the shop drawings for the (2) DOAS units on the roof are incorrect. They are turned degrees the wrong way. This has caused major issues on site that is going to involve additional charges/costs and delays to the project. Apparently, the same situation has occurred on the north tower. We need our roof shop drawing updated immediately to match the correct orientation of the unit as the contract drawings and the submittals show. In the updated shop drawing we are also going to need dimensions from the parapet wall to the correct curb layout since we cannot go off column lines as the roof is already down. I cannot express over email how many trades and contractors are affected by this mistake. I fully expect Pinnacle to resolve this immediately. Avery Denton

I need to know from you just how much responsibility your company will take for this as we begin fixing this situation. Scott Reaves

We have identified issues with the Modera McGavock shop drawings that you have provided for us.
JR Hobbs is requesting for Pinnacle to please correct their mistakes that we have identified. 1. This link is to the current JR Hobbs shop drawings. Note that there are incorrect condenser units on M1.02B. Modera McGavock - JR Hobbs shop drawings - - ADDED COMMENTS FOR LOCATING CONDENSERS.pdf 1. M1.30A shows condenser units that are not labeled. Please identify which units these are supposed to be shown. The first screenshot below, show the current JR Hobbs plans and the errors on the plans. The second screenshot shows the GC drawing where the condenser unit CU is shown on plans. We need to have the CU shown on plans. Please fix.",NEGATIVE

Please avoid making such minor mistakes and submitting poor quality drawings. As far as I remember, pinnacle is where I worked and led the As-built submission for my earlier projects, like Sang Taif and Qassim. EXAMPLE: Please delete and resubmit the drawing below that was submitted from your end, as well as the associated email. This is for your information and action, please resubmit.",NEGATIVE

One small thing to fix for tyndal is the BAC. I think we have it modeled incorrectly. Can you rotate the unit degrees. I think you can keep the EAD duct the same, just readjust the final connection transition. The OAD duct will stay like it. I think we had this one the wrong side to begin with. See attached markup.",NEGATIVE

This is the direction we were given earlier this week. I understand this will cause a lot of changes, but it needs to happen. Glenn Jackson
